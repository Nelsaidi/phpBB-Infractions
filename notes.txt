Issues:
- Lack of OOPness, is it needed, how should it be done best?
- Cache of posts.
- Quoting posts in PM's
- Do we need additional information, if so, is this only admin/mod visible or to the user too?
- A Notes type of infraction? Or lets not overwrite that system now

We need a class for 'garbage' doing, like, a function for checking and recalculating points + expiring infractions, purging infractions

I should move it into classes!!
Damnnn



Our phpbb_infraction api class, we use magic method to overwrite all access calls, a validation array will automatically check and validate all data - NO SQL THING.
our phpbb_infractions::save(phpbb_infraction $infraction) - we ensure only this api can be passed which contains clean data
