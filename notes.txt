18-6 it has been declared that permisions class has everything related to infractions, so one mega classwhich checks permisions etc - add, remove, etc
also, with regards to groups, we will only add, to remove and readd later can cause issues? ask users
additionally, actions is not so modular - it adds a ban or moves to group - with reversability
groups can be used to ban from forums 
ban from topics - how would it be done properly, can be bad - take it into consideration - add methods for this

NO WAIT, LETS NOT HAVE THE MEGA CLASS DO PERMISIONS - MAKES MORE SENSE? LETS DO IT WITHOUT IT IN THERE, AND IF WE NEED TO REUSE CODE THEN
GOD FRIKIN KNOWS


Issues:
- Lack of OOPness, is it needed, how should it be done best?
- Cache of posts.
- Quoting posts in PM's
- Do we need additional information, if so, is this only admin/mod visible or to the user too?
- A Notes type of infraction? Or lets not overwrite that system now

We need a class for 'garbage' doing, like, a function for checking and recalculating points + expiring infractions, purging infractions

I should move it into classes!!
Damnnn




Our phpbb_infraction api class, we use magic method to overwrite all access calls, a validation array will automatically check and validate all data - NO SQL THING.
our phpbb_infractions::save(phpbb_infraction $infraction) - we ensure only this api can be passed which contains clean data
