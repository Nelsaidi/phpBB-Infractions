Issues:
- Lack of OOPness, is it needed, how should it be done best?
- Cache of posts.
- Quoting posts in PM's
- Do we need additional information, if so, is this only admin/mod visible or to the user too?
- A Notes type of infraction? Or lets not overwrite that system now

We need a class for 'garbage' doing, like, a function for checking and recalculating points + expiring infractions, purging infractions

I should move it into classes!!
Damnnn
